# Tensorized Pauli Decomposition Algorithm
## Algorithm
The Algorithm implements the Pauli decomposition of a square matrix.
It is designed to be very fast and also working for sparse format matrices.
Additional features can be the compatibility to other quantum computation tools like Qiskit, pennylane, ...
## Test Suite
The Test Suite compares the result of different Pauli decompositions to verify their correctness.
It can also be used for other algorithms then presented, if the output is in the right format including a list of Pauli Strings and a list/np.array of the coefficients.
